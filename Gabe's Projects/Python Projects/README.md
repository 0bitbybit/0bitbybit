# Welcome to My Imdb Api
***

## Task
Create a back-end program, API, to function as a temporary server
for a movie review repository website. My server program will storage
and make available a list of movies and associated info for five genres
the user can search for using a query string or using /"genre". 

## Description
Used flask, and several associated libraries to setup an IP connection, and 
using JSON tools to transform a csv into JSON to feed to the web server. 
My API is a simple example of a back-end proogram.

## Installation
To install, use a python code editor. Must have internet connection. Must save 
app.py and a csv containing the data you want to parse through.
Must be in the same folder. Simply run the code. This will begin the flask server connection.


## Usage

This program can be either used by entering this into a webpage "/genre" or by using the command line "curl ?genre=western" command
This is how to use the flask server to run this backend api.
```
app.py  no params needed
```
